# **Nutritional Analysis On McDonald's Menu**

**The aim of this project is to calculate the nutrient composition for each menu item based on the available ingredient information and their respective quantities. This involves involves applying appropriate formulas or algorithms to calculate the total calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), and other relevant nutrients**

## **STEPS TAKEN IN THIS PROJECT:**

1. Data Collection: Gather the necessary data, such as the McDonald's menu items and their corresponding ingredient lists and nutritional information. This data can be obtained from official sources, public databases, or API endpoints.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure consistency and usability. This may involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing units of measurement, and formatting the data for analysis.

3. Nutrient Calculation: Calculate the nutrient composition for each menu item based on the available ingredient information and their respective quantities. This step involves applying appropriate formulas or algorithms to calculate the total calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), and other relevant nutrients.


4. Visualization and Reporting: Create visualizations, such as charts or graphs, to present the nutritional analysis findings. These visualizations can help in communicating the insights and patterns effectively. Additionally, generate a comprehensive report summarizing the nutritional analysis results, including any key observations or recommendations.
